# Starlow
A Python 3.9+ Discord bot (Potentially works on 3.7 but untested) for creating and executing turn-based RPG battles. Currently unfinished. Built with the [Hikari](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari) API framework, the command handler [Lightbulb](https://github.com/tandemdude/hikari-lightbulb), and the component handler [Miru](https://github.com/hypergonial/hikari-miru).

## Self-Hosting Instructions

2. Change "\[insert token here]" in `main.py` with your bot's token.
3. Run through `main.py`.
